committees, and publications. The lecturers are given points according to their activities in the continuous learning process.
The Sub-Dataset contains 3 features and 341 instances.


Combined Dataset. The combination of the above Sub-Datasets is prepared for the proposed system when all the Sub-Datasets are
used as a single dataset as input to the system. The data set contains 313 instances with 26 features. The detail of the dataset is
proposed in Table 1. The data labeling for the final decision is released according
to a special rule which is released from the quality assurance department in the university. The detail of the labeling of the final 
decision is described in Table 2.
